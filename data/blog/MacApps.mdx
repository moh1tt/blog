a startup company founded by Josh Miller and Hursh Agrawal.
It was released on 19 April 2022 after having undergone a closed beta test. Arc is available for use on macOS and iOS

The only `con` I found was that it's a sign up to use browser, but it's worth it. More details on it could be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcBrowser/comments/15a5gnp/comment/jtl79je/?context=3)
