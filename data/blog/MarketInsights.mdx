# <a id="overview"></a>Overview

Market Insights is a web application designed to aggregate and present business and news information. The platform includes features such as weather updates and user authentication.

### Technologies Used:

- **Frontend:** Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Flask
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **ORM:** Prisma
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Database Management:** pgAdmin

# <a id="frontend-setup"></a>Frontend Setup

The frontend of the project is built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. To get started with the frontend:

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:

   ```bash
   cd frontend

   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install

   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This will start the frontend server on `http://localhost:3000`.

Key Files and Directories:

- pages/: Contains the Next.js pages.
- components/: Reusable React components.
- styles/: Tailwind CSS configuration and styles.

The backend is implemented using Flask and serves as the API layer for the application.

The backend is implemented using Flask and serves as the API layer for the application.

1. **Navigate to the backend directory**:

   ```bash
   Copy code
   cd backend

   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it**:

   ```bash
   Copy code
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate

   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   Copy code
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   ```

4. **Run the Flask application**:

   ```bash
   Copy code
   flask run

   ```

Key Files:

- app.py: Main Flask application file.
- routes/: Contains Flask routes and API endpoints.

# <a id="database-setup"></a>Database Setup

The project uses PostgreSQL for data storage, managed through Docker and pgAdmin.

1. **Start the PostgreSQL and pgAdmin containers**:

   ```bash
   Copy code
   docker-compose up -d
   Access pgAdmin: Open http://localhost:pgadmin-port in your browser and log in to manage your PostgreSQL databases.

   ```

2. **Run Prisma migrations**:

   ```bash
   Copy code
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

Key Files:

- prisma/schema.prisma: Prisma schema file.
- docker-compose.yml: Docker Compose configuration for PostgreSQL and pgAdmin.

# <a id="running-the-project"></a>Running the Project

To run the full application with both frontend and backend:

1. **Start the backend**:

   ```bash
   Copy code
   cd backend
   flask run

   ```

2. **Start the frontend**:

   ```bash
   Copy code
   cd frontend
   npm run dev

   ```

3. **Ensure Docker containers are running**:

   ```bash
   Copy code
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

# <a id="issues-troubleshooting"></a>Issues & Troubleshooting

- Next.js Command Not Found: Ensure you have installed dependencies in the frontend directory and that next is listed in node_modules/.bin/.
- Flask Application Not Starting: Verify your virtual environment is activated and dependencies are installed.
- Database Connection Issues: Check your Docker containers and ensure the database is running.
